    <p><b>↪ PROBLEM STATEMENT:</b></p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Accidents and Injuries on construction sites are a significant concern, often resulting from workers not wearing proper safety gear. Traditional methods of monitoring safety gear compliance, such as manual inspections, can be time-consuming and error-prone. To address this challenge, a real-time monitoring system has to be developed which can significantly enhance safety by continuously tracking safety gear usage, potentially saving lives and reducing costs associated with accidents.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>🎯 OBJECTIVE:</b></p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The objective is to automate monitoring safety gear compliance, ensuring workers always wear appropriate safety gear. So this system will be a reliable solution to enhance workers' safety while streamlining the monitoring process for construction site supervisors.</p>
