    <p><b>‚Ü™ PROBLEM STATEMENT:</b></p>
    <p>Breast cancer is a type of cancer that forms in the cells of the breast. It is one of the most common types of cancer that affect women, although it can also occur in men. Breast cancer develops when abnormal cells in the breast grow and divide uncontrollably, forming a tumor. Over time, these cancer cells can invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body, a process called metastasis.

Some common risk factors for breast cancer include:

Age: The risk of developing breast cancer increases with age, with most cases occurring in women over 50.
      
Gender: Breast cancer is much more common in women than in men.
      
Family history: Having a close relative (such as a mother, sister, or daughter) who has had breast cancer increases your risk.
      
Genetic mutations: Inherited gene mutations, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, can significantly increase the risk of developing breast cancer
      .
Personal history: If you have had breast cancer in one breast, you have an increased risk of developing it in the other breast or the same breast again.
      
Hormonal factors: Excessive estrogen exposure, early menstruation (before age 12), late menopause (after age 55), and hormone replacement therapy can increase the risk.
      
Lifestyle factors: Obesity, lack of physical activity, excessive alcohol consumption, and smoking have been linked to a higher risk of breast cancer.
Early detection is crucial for successful treatment of breast cancer. It is recommended that women undergo regular breast self-examinations and mammograms as part of their healthcare routine. Common symptoms of breast cancer include a lump or thickening in the breast or underarm, changes in breast size or shape, nipple changes or discharge, and skin changes such as redness or dimpling.

If breast cancer is suspected, further diagnostic tests such as a biopsy, imaging scans (mammogram, ultrasound, MRI), and blood tests may be conducted to determine the presence and extent of cancer.

Treatment options for breast cancer depend on various factors such as the stage of cancer, the presence of hormone receptors, and the individual's overall health. Treatment may involve surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy), radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, targeted therapy, or a combination of these approaches.

It is important to consult with healthcare professionals and specialists who can provide accurate information and guidance specific to your situation if you have concerns about breast cancer.</p>
